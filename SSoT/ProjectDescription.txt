Morse code is a method of transmitting text<Written_language> information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment. It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse<Samuel_F._B._Morse>, an inventor of the telegraph<Telegraph>. The International Morse Code[1]<#cite_note-itu-r-1> encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet<ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet>, some extra Latin letters, the Arabic numerals<Arabic_numerals> and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns<Prosigns_for_Morse_code>) as standardized sequences of short and long signals called "dots" and "dashes",[1]<#cite_note-itu-r-1> or "dits" and "dahs", as in amateur radio<Amateur_radio> practice. Because many non-English natural languages use more than the 26 Roman letters, extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for those languages.

Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character (letter or numeral) or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission. The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence, equal to the dot duration. The letters of a word are separated by<Delimiter> a space equal to three dots (one dash), and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots.[1]<#cite_note-itu-r-1> To increase the speed of the communication, the code was designed so that the length of each character in Morse is approximately inverse to its frequency of occurrence<Entropy_encoding> in English. Thus the most common letter in English, the letter "E", has the shortest code, a single dot.

Morse code is used by some amateur radio operators<Amateur_radio_operator>, although knowledge of and proficiency with it is no longer required for licensing<Amateur_radio_license> in most countries. Pilots<Aviator> and air traffic controllers<Air_traffic_controllers> usually need only a cursory understanding. Aeronautical navigational aids<Navigational_aid>, such as VORs<VHF_omnidirectional_range> and NDBs<Non-directional_beacon>, constantly identify in Morse code. Compared to voice, Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions, yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device. Morse is, therefore, a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels. Many amateur radio repeaters<Amateur_radio_repeater>, for example, identify with Morse, even though they are used for voice communications.

SOS<SOS>, the standard emergency signal, is a Morse code prosign<Prosigns_for_Morse_code>



In an emergency, Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily "keyed" on and off, making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication<Telecommunication>. The most common distress signal is SOS<SOS> â€“ three dots, three dashes, and three dots â€“ internationally recognized by treaty.
